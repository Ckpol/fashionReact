              G-Star Raw is pushing the sustainability movement forward with a collection of stretch denim items for spring 2020 which is particularly designed for reuse. G-Star seeks to contribute to positive change in the denim industry, by using each sustainable innovation as a building block for a future. The brand has been working to recycle its jeans into new since 2012 when it released the first-ever Cradle to Cradle (C2C) Gold level-certified denim in late 2017.
